            Accessibility Guidelines for UI Components:
            
            1. Color and Contrast:
            - Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 for normal text
            - Don't rely solely on color to convey information
            - Provide alternative indicators (icons, text)
            
            2. Keyboard Navigation:
            - All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
            - Logical tab order
            - Visible focus indicators
            
            3. Screen Reader Support:
            - Use semantic HTML elements
            - Provide ARIA labels where needed
            - Include alternative text for images
